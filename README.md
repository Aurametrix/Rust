# Rust
One of the most loved by [developers](http://stackoverflow.com/insights/survey/2016#technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted) languages, but not the most popular. Rust is a systems programming language - more like C++ and Go, and less like Node and Ruby. It is designed for better memory safety than C++ while maintaining performance
[Official site](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/) and
[Github](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust) 

Python has its "eggs" and Ruby has its "gems". Clojure uses the same boring "jars" as other JVM languages. Rust chose to call its format "crates".
