# Rust
One of the most loved by [developers](http://stackoverflow.com/insights/survey/2016#technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted) languages, but not the most popular. Rust is a systems programming language - more like C++ and Go, and less like Node and Ruby. It is designed for better memory safety than C++ while maintaining performance
